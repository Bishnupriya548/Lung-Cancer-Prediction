# Lung-Cancer-Prediction
🫁 Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting lung cancer risk using machine learning techniques based on medical and lifestyle attributes. The goal is to analyze patterns in the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and compare multiple machine learning models to identify the most effective approach for classification.

🎯 Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and feature relationships
Build and compare multiple machine learning models
Evaluate model performance and identify the best-performing algorithm
Analyze feature importance contributing to lung cancer prediction

📊 Dataset Description:
The dataset contains structured medical and lifestyle information, including:
Gender,Age,Smoking,Yellow fingers,Anxiety,Peer pressure,Chronic disease,Fatigue,Allergy,Wheezing
